# Capricorn-Timesheet-extension

# Hackathon Problem
* Create an extension for Dev Ops 
* The extension should be a timesheet that shows, who did the work, how many hours they worked and what project they did work on.
* It should be a single page application
* It should store data in a secure database
* It needs to work on azure Dev ops

# What we did
* Created a single page using html and css
* Used google sheets to store data
* Created an api for our sheet
* Created the extension and publised it to azure Dev ops
